Description: The RELSA package contains a set of functions for relative severity
   assessment in laboratory animals.   In animal-based research, the problem of 
   severity assessment is crucial. As animals cannot communicate their state of
   well-being, scientists need reliable tools for monitoring the severity of
   experimental procedures as closely as possible. It has been shown that a 
   diversity of behavioral tests   (and others) may serve this purpose. However,
   the main issue with these approaches is that they are rather specific and 
   challenging to transfer to other animal models. A comprehensive and 
   easy-to-use toolbox for the multidimensional analysis of such data is RELSA. 
   The RELSA procedure provides an evidence-based, holistic insight into the
   multifaceted topic of severity. In addition, it provides a metric that can 
   compare individual animals, experimental subgroups, and animal models by 
   providing the qualitative context of a reference set.
