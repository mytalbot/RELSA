Description: The RELSA package contains a set of functions for relative severity assessment in laboratory animals.
   In animal-based research, the problem of severity classification is crucial. As animals cannot communicate their state of well-being, 
   scientists need reliable tools for monitoring severity as closely as possible. It has been shown that a diversity of behavioral tests 
   (and others) may serve this purpose. However, the main issue with these approaches is that they are rather specific and difficult to
   transfer to other animal models. A comprehensive and easy-to-use toolbox for the assessment and comparison of different variables and 
   animal models is missing. RELSA offers first insight into this topic by providing a composite score for an arbitrary number of input 
   variables and the possibility of comparing different animal models based on actual value changes within a relative context. 
   This will allow close severity monitoring of individual animals but also bulk-analysis of overall reached severity levels of entire models.
