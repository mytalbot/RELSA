## Relative Severity Assessment Score (RELSA)
The RELSA package contains a set of functions for **assessing relative severity in laboratory animals**. In animal-based research, the problem of severity classification is crucial. As animals cannot communicate their state of well-being, scientists need reliable tools for monitoring severity as closely as possible. It has been shown that a diversity of behavioral tests (and others) may serve this purpose. However, the main issue with these approaches is that they are rather specific and challenging to transfer. A comprehensive and easy-to-use toolbox for assessing and comparing different variables and animal models is missing. RELSA offers the first glimpse into this matter by combining any set of experimental outcome variables into a single composite score.

## Installation

You can install the development version of RELSA by running:

```
devtools::install_github("mytalbot/relsa", build_vignettes = TRUE)
library(RELSA)
```

## Documentation
This package is documented using pkgdown, and the resulting website is available [here](https://talbotsr.com/RELSA), where detailed tutorials can be found covering aspects of package functionality. See reference section for detailed function documentation.

## Data availability
Raw data with labeled subgroups (treatment/condition columns) can be found in the GitHub repository folder "raw_data".
Data are stored in four *.txt files. [Here is the direct link](https://github.com/mytalbot/RELSA/tree/master/raw_data). 
The data in the file "tm_post-op.txt" is also internalized in the RELSA package and can be called with: `RELSA::surgery`. 


## Example
 
```{r echo=TRUE}
library(RELSA)

# Build model -------------------------------------------------------------
raw          <- RELSA::surgery
vars         <- c("bwc", "burON", "hr", "hrv", "temp", "act")
turnvars     <- c("hr", "temp" )
pre          <- relsa_norm(cbind(raw[,1:4], raw[,vars]), 
                           normthese = c("burON", "hr", "hrv", "temp", "act"), ontime = 1)
bsl          <- relsa_baselines(dataset = pre, bslday = -1, variables = vars, turnvars = turnvars)
levels       <- relsa_levels(pre, bsl = bsl, drops = NULL, turns = c("hr","temp"),
                             k = 4, customCol = c("red", "green", "blue", "magenta"))

# Test model --------------------------------------------------------------
animal       <- 1
RELSA        <- relsa(set = pre, bsl, a = animal, turnvars = turnvars)
head(RELSA$relsa$rms)

```
